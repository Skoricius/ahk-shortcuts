# My personal AHK shortcuts

All the most important shortcuts that I use on most of my computers are in Basic.ahk. Situational shortcuts are in the other folders.

For the wallpaper change, need to edit the wallpaper variables at the beginning of the script.

These include: 
	
* makes NumLock always on and CapsLock always off
* RAlt+t makes the current window always on top and transparent
* RAlt+l changes the audio output
* Maps RAlt & Left/Right to LAlt & Left/Right (for convenience in browsers)
* Maps AppsKey & Left/Right to Home/End (mainly for convenience on some keyboards)
* Maps AppsKey & Up/Down to Pgup/Pgdn (again, for convenience on some keyboards)
* Maps LAlt & X to LAlt & F4 (closing a program)
* Shift + Wheel for horizontal scrolling
* Runs KeyboardMouse on RAlt & M
* Changes windows color mode and background on RAlt & C (from switching to dark mode during the * night)
* RAlt+k kill all A/*HK scripts
* Some useful macros for special symbols
